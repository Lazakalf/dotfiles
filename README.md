#Jay's dotfiles
  
My dotfiles for: 
i3-gaps
i3-blocks
zsh
ranger
vim

urxvt
Some configurations/keybindings are specific to Arch Linux and the keyboard of my thinkpad  
I need to clean out a lot of junk. This is a work in progress. Currently in beta.
Still need to add configs for irssi, mpd & ncmpcpp, & urxvt. Installation Script coming soon.

##To recreate a minimal install with my current setup
  * Install Arch Linux or Net Install of Debian
  
  * Install xorg-server, i3wm-gaps, lightdm, gnome-terminal, rofi, i3status, i3-lock-wrapper, i3bar, gvim, python2, powerline, compton, ranger, irssi, zsh, oh-my-zsh, git

  * Copy over dotfiles to ~/

  * Install fonts (Terminus, FontAwesome, Terminess Powerline, Inconsolata for Powerline)

  * Change default shell to zsh

  * Fix everything that's broken
